## Purpose
To make a 3D First-Person Shooter game from scratch with documentations and plans to deepen my knowledge,
what I got in the university so far, and have a fully functional game.

## Tools
I'm going to use some libraries and APIs, especially for graphics.
- C++17
- OpenGL 4.3
- stb_image

For diagrams, I'm going to use [draw.io](https://draw.io)

## Concept
The project concept is to make a Quake-ish game with own implemented collision detection and physics engine.
The player's goal is to destroy every enemy, get the key and get to the end of the map.
<br>On the maps there's going to be pickup able health packs, ammunition, extra weapons, and the key to the exit.
### There will be two types of enemies: 
- zombie-like which runs towards to player and cause melee damage
- shooter which shoots at the player

If the player dies, the map restarts.

## Stages
There's going to be multiple stages of the development.

### Stages with Checklist

Goal is to make a simple "Game" where you can walk around and load different map
